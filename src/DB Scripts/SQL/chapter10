/* chapter 10 */ -- Creating other Schema Objects

-- Schema Objects/ Database Objects (Tables , Views , Index , Sequence , Synonyms)

-- create view
create view empvu80 as
    select * from employees
    where department_id = 80;

CREATE  or replace VIEW  empvu80
AS SELECT  employee_id, last_name, salary
   FROM    employees
   WHERE   department_id = 80;

select * from empvu80;

-- create view using aliases
CREATE VIEW 	salvu50
AS SELECT  employee_id ID_NUMBER, last_name NAME,
           salary*12 ANN_SALARY
   FROM    employees
   WHERE   department_id = 50;

-- modifying a View
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW empvu80
            (id_number, name, sal, department_id)
AS SELECT  employee_id, first_name || ' '
    || last_name, salary, department_id
   FROM    employees
   WHERE   department_id = 80;

-- creating a complex view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW dept_sum_vu
            (name, minsal, maxsal, avgsal)
AS SELECT   d.department_name, MIN(e.salary),
            MAX(e.salary),AVG(e.salary)
   FROM     employees e JOIN departments d
    ON       (e.department_id = d.department_id)
   GROUP BY d.department_name;

select * from dept_sum_vu;

-- Using the With CHECK OPTION CONSTRAINT Clause
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW empvu20
AS SELECT	*
   FROM     employees
   WHERE    department_id = 20
WITH CHECK OPTION CONSTRAINT empvu20_ck ;

-- can't perform modifying on view when using WITH CHECK OPTION CONSTRAINT clause
update empvu20
set DEPARTMENT_ID = 10
where EMPLOYEE_ID = 201;

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW empvu20
AS SELECT	*
   FROM     employees
   WHERE    department_id = 20;

update empvu20
set DEPARTMENT_ID = 10
where EMPLOYEE_ID = 201;

-- ensure that no DML operations on view
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW empvu20
AS SELECT	*
   FROM     employees
   WHERE    department_id = 20
With READ ONLY;

--Denying DML Operations
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW empvu10
            (employee_number, employee_name, job_title)
AS SELECT	employee_id, last_name, job_id
   FROM     employees
   WHERE    department_id = 10
WITH READ ONLY ;

-- : cannot perform a DML operation on a read-only view
delete from empvu10
where empvu10.employee_number = 200;

-- Removing a View
DROP VIEW empvu80;


--Creating a Sequence
CREATE SEQUENCE dept_deptid_seq
    INCREMENT BY 10
    START WITH 120
    MAXVALUE 9999
    NOCACHE
    NOCYCLE;

-- using nextval and currval with sequence
create sequence seq_test
    increment by 1
    start with 1
    maxvalue 20
    nocycle
    nocache;

-- using nextval and currval with sequence
create sequence sequence_test
    increment by 1
    start with 1
    maxvalue 20
    nocycle
    nocache;

DROP TABLE EX;

create table ex (
    id number ,
    name varchar2(20)
);

insert into ex values (seq_test.nextval , 'Tamer');
insert into ex values (seq_test.nextval , 'Ahmed');
insert into ex values (seq_test.nextval , 'Ali');
insert into ex values (seq_test.nextval , 'Hossam');

select * from ex;

select seq_test.currval from DUAL;

DROP SEQUENCE SEQUENCE_TEST;


--- Alter s Sequence
ALTER SEQUENCE dept_deptid_seq
    INCREMENT BY 20
    MAXVALUE 999999
    NOCACHE
    NOCYCLE;

-- Indexes
create index emp_last_name_idx on EMPLOYEES(LAST_NAME);

DROP INDEX emp_last_name_idx;

-- Synonyms
CREATE SYNONYM  d_sum
    FOR  dept_sum_vu;

-- create synonym
CREATE SYNONYM  depts
    FOR  DEPARTMENTS;

-- use synonym
select * from depts;

-- drop synonym
drop synonym depts;
